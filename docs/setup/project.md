# Project setup

The installation process will be explained for **Linux**. It is also possible to install on Windows and MacOs (not tested) if the required dependencies have support for those OS.

> Please note that if you do not use Linux and you want to use the Taobotics IMUs, you will have to manage its drivers.

The project has been tested in `Windows 11` without IMUs, and in `Ubuntu 12.04 LTS` with Taobotics IMUs.

## Dependencies

- **Python version `3.10` or `3.11`**. In case you want to use recent versions, check the [requirements](../requirements.txt) for potential conflicts with the required python modules.
- **Phidget22**. For Phidget load cells and encoders.
- **MRPT**. To use the `pymrpt` library for the Taobotics IMUs.

## Installation procedure

**Work in progress**
