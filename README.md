## Information

A python software for synchronized data management of specific force platforms sensors compatible with Phidget API and other sensor types such as IMUs.

This project is part of the author's master's thesis in industrial engineering at the University of AlmerÃ­a. force_platform is licensed under de GNU General Public License v3.0.

![Main UI](docs/images/mainUI.png)

It supports currently the following sensor types:
- Phidget-Bridge compatible load sensors. (Requires Phidget dependency).
- Phidget encoders. (Requires Phidget dependency).
- Taobotics IMU sensors. (Requires MRPT dependency).
- USB webcams for video recording with opencv.

## Documentation

Program documentation is available to learn how the program works and its usage.
